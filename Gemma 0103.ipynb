Do not rely solely on keywords; always interpret the intended meaning within context before classifying.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When classifying a tweet as related to older persons, please note the following rules. Please do not consider a tweet related to an older person when: \n",
    "    (1) tweets describe old objects (e.g., “old car,” “old house”) unless the term refers to an old body part (e.g., “old knees” or “old brain”). \n",
    "    (2) “old,” refers to “old + testament” or old refers to something that is not an older person, like \"the old you,\" \"the old we,\" \"old time,\" \"old adage,\" or \"old outhouse\"  \n",
    "    (3) “senior(s)” refers to high school or college seniors. \n",
    "    (4) “pop” refers to soda, a verb, music, food (“pop tart”), or could refer to a younger person (e.g., “my pop” could mean a young “dad”). \n",
    "    (5) For “elder” refers to Elder Scrolls (the video game). \n",
    "    (6) For “granny,” refers to granny smith which is an apple. \n",
    "    (7) For “antique” and “ancient,” describes objects rather than people. \n",
    "    (8) For “nursing home,” “assisted living,” or “care home,” does not refer to older persons.\n",
    "    (9) the keyword “elder” is only referring to someone who is older than someone else, such as an “elder sibling,”  but is not referring to an older person.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In addition to the rules listed above, please apply the following clarification rules:\n",
    "    (1) Tweets that mention dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, memory loss, cognitive decline, or similar conditions may be classified as ageist, even if the tone appears sympathetic. This because the stereotype that all older persons develop dementia is a common negative age stereotype \n",
    "    (2) Tweets that portray an older adult in a negative, mocking, complaining, or burdensome way (such as criticizing their cooking, speech, driving, abilities, slowness, confusion, or behavior) should be classified as ageist, even if the tweet is casual or humorous. For example, “my grandma’s cooking smells terrible” or “grandpa won’t stop repeating himself” are ageist.\n",
    "    (3) Tweets that express positive affection, respect, gratitude, pride, love, or admiration for an older adult should be classified as age-positive, including when someone says they miss or cherish an older relative who has passed away. This type of emotional remembrance about older persons counts as age-positive.\n",
    "    (4) Tweets that describe celebrating an older person, including celebrating a birthday, should be counted as age-positive.\n",
    "    (5) The word “retired” should only be coded as aging-related when it describes a person retiring due to age, not when it is used jokingly (e.g., “I’m retired from dating”).\n",
    "    (6) The term “middle-aged” does not count as older adulthood and should not be classified as aging-related.\n",
    "    (7) When terms like “grandma,” “grandpa,” or “old man” are used metaphorically to describe the speaker’s behavior in an ambiguous way (e.g., staying in and going to bed early), code as not relevant; However, if is clear the behavior is thought of in a negative way, code as ageist. \n",
    "    (8) tweets that infantilize older persons or treat them like babies or small children should be labeled as ageist.\n",
